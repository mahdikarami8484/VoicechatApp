It is a simple VoiceChat appliction in C# and .NET.

I used Windows Form for the user interface because this program is only for learning sockets and a simple example of VoiceChat and may have problems and errors in real practice.

This project is in the form of two client and server programs and the logic of its operation is very simple and non-practical.
